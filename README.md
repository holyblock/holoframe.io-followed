# ðŸŽ¬ Quick Start

## Manual setup

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


> clone/fork ðŸ‘¾ core:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hologramxyz/core.git
```

> install all ðŸ•¸ dependencies:

```bash
cd core
yarn install
```

> add a dependency:

```bash
yarn workspace <workspace_name> add <packages> 
```

### Contracts

Prerequisite: 
1. create .env file in accordance to example.env
2. for deploying to mainnet with hd wallet, add mnemonic.txt file in contract root
3. specify network name (ex. goerli) and networks in hardhat.config.js

> run local dev chain

```bash
yarn chain
```

> run contract tests

```bash
yarn test-contracts
```

> run contract deploy script (contracts/deploy)

```bash
yarn deploy-contracts
```

> upload model and image for single Honorary to Arweave via Bundlr
1. Under contracts/assets/honoraries, add folder with model file (.zip for Live2D, .glb for 3D), image file, and gif file in it. Give a consistent name for the honorary (ex. folder coolcat4800 with coolcat4800.zip and coolcat4800.png inside)
2. Go to contracts/scripts/uploadHonoraryAssetFolder.js, set "assetName" to the name you gave the asset folder in step 1 (ex. coolcat4800)
3. In terminal in project root, run the following command from project root
```bash
yarn upload-asset-folder
```
4. If need to upload any files separately, set "assetFilePath" in contracts/scripts/uploadHonoraryAssetFile.js, then run the following command from project root
```bash
yarn upload-asset-file
```

> upload tokenURI for single Honorary to Arweave via Bundlr (after uploading model and image)
1. Open contracts/utils/honoraryAssetURIs.json, add a new tokenURI JSON for the honorary whose assets you just uploaded to the array. Make sure the name field matches with the name of the honorary. 
2. Go to contracts/scripts/uploadHonoraryURIs.js, set "targetURIName" to the name of the honorary.
3. In terminal in project root, run the following command
```bash
yarn upload-uri
```
4. Keep track of the txID output of the console log upon successful upload. The new tokenURI link to use for minting the honorary is "https://arweave.net/<txID>" 


> run NFT minting script for honorary NFT (contracts/scripts/mintHoloHonorary.js)
1. Fill in "tokenURI" variable
2. Run command below from project root

```bash
yarn mint-honorary
```

> create new NFT collection from factory contract (contracts/scripts/createHoloCollection.js)
1. Fill in "name", "symbol", "originAddr", "totalSupply", and "royaltyBPS" variables
2. Run command below from project root

```bash
yarn mint-honorary
```

> (DEPRECATED) create Arweave manifest to generate relative paths (for using Ardrive)

```bash
ardrive create-manifest -f "<ardrive_folder_id>" -w <path_to_arweave_wallet_json>
```

### Desktop

Prerequisites:

cd desktop
```
3. Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

> start development mode:
```bash

```bash
yarn run package
```

### Extension

Prerequisites:

REACT_APP_INFURA_RPC_KEY
ALTER_API_KEY
